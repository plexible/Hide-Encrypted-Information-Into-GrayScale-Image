# A secure system by combining encryption for data transfer and information hiding techniques for data authentication.

# Secure Data Transfer and Information Hiding Project

## Overview
This project aims to explore security mechanisms, focusing on data transfer encryption and information hiding techniques for data authentication. The goal is to develop a program that securely embeds personal information into a gray scale medical image and later extracts that information from the modified image.

## Project Features
- **Encryption Algorithm**: The project includes the design and implementation of an encryption algorithm for securing personal information.
- **Cipher Algorithms**
- **Image Modification (Embedding)**: Personal information will be embedded into a gray scale medical image using the designed algorithm.
- **Information Extraction**: The program will be capable of extracting personal information from the modified gray scale medical image.
- **GUI**: A user interface was designed to use the program
